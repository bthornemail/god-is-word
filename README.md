# Have You Ever Wondered About God?

## Just a Question

I'm genuinely asking.

Not trying to convince you of anything. Not selling a belief. Just curious if you've ever stopped and actually thought about itâ€”really thought about it.

## Some Questions I Have

**Have you ever wondered what God is?**  
Not what you were told. Not what you're supposed to think. What do *you* actually think when you hear that word?

**Would you want to know what everyone else thinks?**  
Like, actually know. Not filtered through media or institutions or arguments. Just... what does a person in Japan think? What about someone in Brazil? Your neighbor? A stranger on the other side of the world?

**If you could ask the question and get an honest answerâ€”would you ask it?**

**If someone asked you, would you answer honestly?**  
Even if your answer was "I don't know" or "nothing" or "I've never thought about it"â€”would you share that?

## What I Can't Figure Out

Yesterday I asked on Facebook: "What do people who don't believe in God think *about* God?"

Because here's what confuses meâ€”if you don't believe in something, do you still think about it? And if you do think about it, what are you thinking *about*?

Like, I genuinely can't fathom the concept. Not in a judgmental way. In a "I don't understand how that works" way.

Because even "God doesn't exist" is still an answer to "what is God?"  
Even "I don't believe" is still a relationship to the concept.  
Even "I've never thought about it" tells me something.

## The Bigger Questions

**What do you think God means?**  
Anything? Nothing? Something you can't put into words?

**Does God have meaning?**  
Or is meaning something we made up?

**If God doesn't have meaning, then what does?**  
You? Me? Love? Money? Nothing? Everything?

**Does meaning even exist?**

And if it doesn'tâ€”why are we asking these questions?  
And if it doesâ€”where does it come from?

## What If We Just Asked?

Not as a debate. Not as research. Not to prove anything.

Just as a genuine, honest, collective moment of curiosity:

**What if everyone on Earth, at the same time, was asked one simple question?**

> "God is _____?"

One word. That's it.

What would happen?

Would patterns emerge?  
Would we see something we've never seen before?  
Would we learn something about ourselves by seeing what we all think?

## Why I Made This

I created a toolâ€”a simple appâ€”because I wanted to know the answer.

Not *the* answer, like some universal truth handed down from the sky.  
But *an* answer. The collective answer. The natural image of what humanity actually thinks when we're all honest at the same time.

**7 days. 1 word per day. Everyone participates.**

No pressure. No judgment. No "right answer."

Just you, at the end of your day, answering honestly:

- Day 1: God is _____?
- Day 2: God is _____?
- ...
- Day 7: God is _____?

Then we look at all the answers together. Not to judge them. But to *see* them.

## What This Isn't

This isn't:
- A religious movement
- A way to convert anyone
- Research for a paper or book
- A data collection scheme
- Something you have to believe in to participate

You can think God is real.  
You can think God is fake.  
You can think God is a word that doesn't mean anything.  
You can think you don't know what you think.

**All of those are valid answers.**

## What This Could Be

A mirror.

When billions of people answer the same question honestly, we see something we can't see alone.

Maybe we see that most people think about God the same way.  
Maybe we see that everyone thinks about it completely differently.  
Maybe we see patterns we didn't expect.  
Maybe we see nothing at all.

**But at least we'd know.**

And knowing what we all actually thinkâ€”not what we're told we think, not what we argue about, not what divides usâ€”but what we *honestly* think?

That feels important.

Or maybe it doesn't. I don't know. That's why I'm asking.

## Would You Participate?

If this existedâ€”if you could answer one word per day for 7 days, completely privately, and then see what everyone else answered (if they chose to share)â€”would you do it?

Would you be curious?

Would you want to know what your answer is?  
Would you want to know what everyone else's answer is?

**Would you ask the question if you could have the answer?**

## The Tool Exists

I built it because I needed to know. Not because I have answers. Because I have questions.

It's called **The 7-Day God Mirror**.

- Privacy-first (stored only on your device)
- One word per day for 7 days
- Optional sharing via cryptographic signature
- See patterns emerge when others share their answers
- No tracking, no accounts, no strings attached

You can use it alone, just for yourself.  
Or you can share your answers and see the collective pattern.

**It's a question, not a statement.**

## Final Thought

I don't know if finding the answer is important.

But I think *asking the question* might be.

Because whether God exists or not, whether meaning exists or not, whether any of this matters or notâ€”we're still here, asking.

And maybe that's the answer already.  
Or maybe it's not.  

**But I'd like to know what you think.**
