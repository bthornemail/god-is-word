# Unified Architecture System Outline

The entire architecture is defined by the interaction of two main layers: the **Execution Layer (UTCF SystemState)** and the **Consensus Layer (Perceptron State)**.

> This document outlines a complete, bipartite computational and consensus system. This system is designed to provide mathematically verifiable and cryptographically auditable state transitions, achieving Byzantine fault tolerance through an isomorphic mapping between abstract geometric invariants and concrete computational results.

## 1. The Bipartite Architecture (UTCF $\leftrightarrow$ Perceptron)

The system operates on a fundamental duality:

| Layer | Component | Role | Speed | Scope | Key Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Execution** | **UTCF SystemState** ($\text{M}$) | **Fast computation** and state transformation. | Fast ($\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$) | Local Node | $\text{M}_{n+1}$ (New Matrix State) |
| **Consensus** | **Perceptron State** ($\mathcal{P}$) | **Slower cryptographic verification** and Byzantine consensus. | Slower (Cryptographic overhead) | Distributed Network | $\text{S}$ (Cryptographically Signed Proof) |

### Binding Functions

The integrity of the system relies on **Binding Functions** that translate the computational result from the UTCF layer into a verifiable, cryptographic proof for the Perceptron layer.

1. **Generate\_Consensus\_Proof ($\text{SystemState} \to \mathcal{P}$):** Extracts geometric invariants ($\text{I}$) and Betti Numbers ($\beta_0, \beta_1$) from the new matrix state $\text{M}_{n+1}$. It then generates a **Metric Signature ($\text{S}$)** using the private key and temporal index ($\tau_{\text{State}}$) and encodes the result into an **IPv6 address**.
2. **Verify\_Consensus\_Proof ($\mathcal{P} \to \text{boolean}$):** Verifies the received signature ($\text{S}$) with the Public Key, checks that the geometric invariants match the locally computed state, and confirms the Integrity Score ($\text{I}$) meets the threshold ($\ge 0.8$).

## 2. Execution Layer: UTCF SystemState ($\text{M}$)

The UTCF layer's purpose is to perform the actual computation, which is encoded as a **matrix transformation**.

### Core Equation and Decomposition

Every computational state is encoded as a square matrix $\text{M} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, and any state transition ($\Delta\text{T}$) is an addition:

$$\text{M}_{n+1} = \text{M}_n + \Delta\text{T}$$

The system provides a **4-Component Functional Decomposition** of the state matrix:

$$\text{M} = \alpha\mathbf{S} + \beta\mathbf{R} + \gamma\mathbf{G} + \delta\mathbf{C}$$

| Component | Symbol | Role (Operational Semantics) | Default Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stability** | $\mathbf{S}$ | Self-consistent baseline (Diagonal-dominant) | $\alpha = 0.4$ |
| **Rotation** | $\mathbf{R}$ | Directional transformations (Antisymmetric) | $\beta = 0.3$ |
| **Growth** | $\mathbf{G}$ | Magnitude changes (Logarithmic scaling) | $\gamma = 0.2$ |
| **Connectivity** | $\mathbf{C}$ | Interaction topology (Binary adjacency) | $\delta = 0.1$ |

### Coherence and Integrity

The validity of a computed state is determined by the **Integrity Score ($\text{I}$)** and the **Connectivity Metrics** (Betti Numbers $\beta_i$), which are topological invariants derived from the connectivity matrix $\mathbf{C}$.

* **Equilibrium ($v^*$):** The system's steady-state direction, computed as the **principal eigenvector** of the reconstructed matrix $\hat{\text{M}}$ using **Power Iteration** ($\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$).
* **Coherence Criterion:** A state is considered operationally **coherent** if:
    $$\beta_0 = 1 \land \beta_1 = 0 \land \text{I} \ge 0.8$$
    This translates to: **Single connected component** ($\beta_0=1$), **no independent cycles** ($\beta_1=0$), and **high consistency** ($\text{I} \ge 0.8$).

## 3. Consensus Layer: Perceptron State ($\mathcal{P}$)

The Perceptron is the ordered 8-tuple defining the full agent state: $\mathcal{P} = [\text{H}, \text{L}, \text{K}, \text{I}, \text{F}, \text{T}, \text{B}, \text{D}]$.

### Key Components

* **$\text{H}$ (Hilbert Space):** Provides the $\mathcal{L}_2$-norm space of all possible conceptual states, serving as the **total working vocabulary and knowledge context**. It includes **Monad** and **Functor** primitives that are isomorphic to the **Mantissa** and **Exponent** of the $\text{IEEE\_754}$ floating-point standard.
* **$\text{K}$ (Cryptographic Identity):** Contains the tools for sovereignty proof, including the **Private\_Key** (for signing) and **Public\_Key** (for verification, stored in $\text{H}$).
* **$\text{I}$ (Geometric Invariants):** Holds the geometric structures used for verifiable consensus:
  * **Block\_Design (7, 3, 1, 3, 7):** Specifically the **Fano Plane** structure, used for P2P synchronization.
  * **Betti\_Numbers ($\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots$):** Topological invariants checked against the UTCF result.
* **$\text{T}$ (Semantic & Epistemic Basis):** Defines the irreducible structure for verifiable knowledge assertions as a quadruple: **Subject, Predicate, Object, Modality**.

### Propagation Flow (The Constraint)

The entire system is bound by the **Constraint** that guarantees mathematical soundness and auditability:

$$\forall \text{ state transitions: } \mathbf{F}(\text{M}_n, \Delta\text{T}) = \text{M}_{n+1} \implies \mathbf{B}(\text{S}, \text{H}, \text{I}) = \text{Valid}$$

In short, **every forward-propagated state must produce a valid backward-propagated signature**. This ensures deterministic convergence and cryptographic auditability against Byzantine faults through a $>\frac{2\text{N}}{3}$ agreement threshold.
