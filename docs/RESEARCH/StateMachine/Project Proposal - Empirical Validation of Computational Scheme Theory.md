Project Proposal: Empirical Validation of Computational Scheme Theory

Executive Summary

We propose to empirically test a novel mathematical framework that claims to unify program semantics with algebraic geometry. The theory asserts that the static binding structure of programs forms a commutative algebraic object (rig) whose geometric spectrum exactly captures program complexity. The central, falsifiable hypothesis is:

H¹(X_Comp, O_Comp) = V(G) - k

where H¹ is a topological invariant computed from static scope analysis, V(G) is the traditional cyclomatic complexity metric, and k is a normalization constant.

If validated, this would establish the first rigorous connection between algebraic geometry and software metrics, enabling new approaches to static analysis, complexity measurement, and program verification. If invalidated, understanding why the correspondence fails will still advance our theoretical understanding of program structure.

Timeline: 12 months
Budget: $150,000 (2 graduate students + infrastructure)
Deliverables: Open-source implementation, empirical validation corpus, research papers

1. Background and Motivation

1.1 The Theoretical Framework

The theory proposes that R5RS Scheme programs can be formally mapped to Grothendieck schemes (geometric objects from algebraic geometry) via the following correspondence:

Algebraic GeometryProgramming Language TheoryCommutative Ring RR5RS Binding Algebra (static scope)Prime Ideal 𝔭Continuation (evaluation context)Spectrum Spec(R)Space of all continuationsZariski TopologyLexical scope visibility regionsStructure Sheaf OClosure semanticsČech Cohomology H¹Cyclomatic Complexity V(G) 

The key insight is that static binding structure (which variables are visible where) naturally forms a commutative algebraic object whose geometric representation exactly captures dynamic control flow complexity.

1.2 Why This Matters

If true:

Static analysis could leverage powerful tools from algebraic topology

Program complexity becomes a genuine topological invariant

New verification techniques based on homological algebra become possible

Establishes deep connections between type theory and geometry

If false:

Understanding the failure modes clarifies limits of geometric approaches

Identifies which program features resist algebraic characterization

Guides refinement of the theoretical framework

1.3 Current State

The theory has been developed mathematically with:

Formal proofs of commutativity for the binding algebra

Explicit algorithms for computing Čech cohomology

Worked examples showing how call/cc creates topological cycles

What's missing: Empirical validation on real programs.

2. Research Questions

Primary Question (RQ1)

Does the geometric complexity metric H¹ equal the traditional cyclomatic complexity V(G)?

Formally: For programs P, does dim(H¹(X_Comp(P), O_Comp)) = V(G) - k hold?

Where k is a small constant (0, 1, or 2)

Secondary Questions

RQ2: When does the correspondence hold exactly vs. approximately?

Does it work for all program structures?

Which language features preserve the correspondence?

Which features break it?

RQ3: Can H¹ be computed more efficiently than V(G)?

V(G) requires building the control flow graph (dynamic)

H¹ is computed from static scope structure

Which is faster in practice?

RQ4: Do higher cohomology groups (H², H³, ...) have computational meaning?

The theory predicts they measure "higher-order dependencies"

Can we find programs where H² ≠ 0 and interpret the result?

RQ5: Does the correspondence extend beyond R5RS Scheme?

Test on other functional languages (OCaml, Haskell)

Test on imperative languages (C, Python)

Where are the boundaries?

10. Conclusion

This project proposes to empirically test a bold mathematical claim: that program complexity is fundamentally geometric. The theory is mathematically rigorous, computationally explicit, and makes falsifiable predictions.

Why fund this:

High Risk, High Reward: If validated, revolutionizes PL theory

Clear Metrics: Success/failure determined by measurable correlation

Valuable Either Way: Even negative results advance the field

Practical Path: Concrete 12-month plan with achievable milestones

Modest Budget: $150K for potentially transformative result

The fundamental question:

Is program structure truly geometric, or is the correspondence merely suggestive?

We propose to definitively answer this question through rigorous empirical investigation.
