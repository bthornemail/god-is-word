Rumsfeldian Analysis: Implementation Strategy for Computational Scheme Theory

The Known Knowns

What we can actually implement right now

1. The Binding Algebra R_Scheme (Partial)

;; We KNOW how to represent bindings (define (make-binding identifier scope-id type) (list 'binding identifier scope-id type)) ;; We KNOW how to track scope structure (define (make-scope parent-scope bindings) (list 'scope parent-scope bindings)) ;; We KNOW how to do alpha-equivalence checking (define (alpha-equivalent? expr1 expr2 renaming) ;; Standard algorithm - this is proven technology ...) 

Implementable today:

Static scope analysis (producing binding trees)

Hygienic macro expansion (R5RS macros already do this)

Scope visibility computation (which identifiers are accessible where)

2. The Topology τ_Scope (Computable)

;; D(f) = set of program points where binding f is visible (define (compute-visibility-region binding ast) (filter (lambda (node) (binding-accessible? binding node)) (all-nodes ast))) ;; This is just static scope analysis! (define (lexical-scope-map program) (let ((bindings (extract-bindings program))) (map (lambda (b) (cons b (compute-visibility-region b program))) bindings))) 

Implementable today:

Map every binding to its lexical scope region

Compute scope intersections, unions

Verify basic topological properties (D(1) = whole program, etc.)

3. Closures as Sheaf Sections (Already Exists!)

;; R5RS closures ARE sheaf sections! (define (make-closure params body env) (lambda args (eval body (extend-env params args env)))) ;; The "restriction map" is just lexical scoping (define (restrict-closure closure inner-scope) ;; A closure in outer scope restricts naturally to inner scope closure) ;; by design! 

Implementable today:

Verify sheaf gluing empirically on test cases

Check that closures compose correctly across scope boundaries

Demonstrate that closure semantics satisfies uniqueness

The Known Unknowns

What we know we need but don't know how to implement

1. Ring Operations on R_Scheme

What we need:

;; Addition of bindings - what does this MEAN? (define (binding-add b1 b2) ???) ;; Union? Alternative? Something else? ;; Multiplication of bindings - composition? (define (binding-mult b1 b2) ???) ;; Nested scope? Sequential binding? ;; We need to verify ring axioms (define (verify-ring-axioms bindings) (and (check-associativity bindings) (check-commutativity bindings) ;; THE BIG ONE (check-distributivity bindings) (check-identity bindings))) 

Research needed:

What algebraic structure does the binding graph actually have?

Is it a semiring? A lattice? Something weaker?

Can we prove commutativity or must we weaken to non-commutative AG?

Experimental approach:

;; Try different candidate operations (define (test-binding-algebra operations test-cases) (for-each (lambda (ops) (printf "Testing ~a\n" ops) (check-ring-axioms-empirically ops test-cases)) candidate-operations)) 

2. The k ↦ 𝔭_k Construction

What we need:

;; Capture continuation and extract its "prime ideal" (define (continuation->prime-ideal k) (call/cc (lambda (current-k) ;; Need to inspect current-k's structure ;; Extract: which bindings are out-of-scope? (let ((accessible (accessible-bindings current-k)) (all-bindings (all-program-bindings))) (set-difference all-bindings accessible))))) 

The problem:

Continuations are opaque in R5RS

No standard way to "inspect" them

No way to extract their environment structure

Possible hack:

;; Continuation annotation approach (define *continuation-metadata* (make-hash-table)) (define (annotated-call/cc proc) (call/cc (lambda (k) (let ((point-id (gensym)) (env-snapshot (current-environment))) (hash-table-set! *continuation-metadata* point-id env-snapshot) (proc (lambda (v) (k (list point-id v)))))))) 

3. Cohomology Computation

What we need:

;; Compute H^0 (global sections) (define (compute-H0 sheaf space) (filter (lambda (section) (valid-everywhere? section space)) (all-sections sheaf))) ;; Compute H^1 (obstructions to gluing) (define (compute-H1 sheaf covering) (let ((local-sections (map sheaf covering))) (compute-cocycle-classes local-sections))) 

The problem:

What exactly IS the continuation sheaf K?

How do we represent it computationally?

What are "sections" of K?

Possible approach:

;; Continuation sheaf as a data structure (define (make-continuation-sheaf) (lambda (scope-region) ;; Return all continuations valid in this region (filter (lambda (k) (valid-in-region? k scope-region)) *all-reachable-continuations*))) 

The Unknown Knowns

What we're actually doing without realizing it's the theory

1. Every Compiler Already Computes Spec!

;; Standard scope analysis IS computing the spectrum! (define (analyze-scopes ast) (let ((binding-graph (build-binding-graph ast))) (for-each (lambda (node) (set-node-env! node (compute-visible-bindings node))) (ast-nodes ast)))) ;; This IS: X_Comp = Spec(R_Scheme) ;; Each node ↔ a "point" (continuation) ;; Each node's environment ↔ residue field R/𝔭 

Revelation:

Standard compiler passes ALREADY implement pieces of this

We just need to recognize what they're computing geometrically

The "implementation" may just be re-interpreting existing tech!

2. Type Checkers Verify Sheaf Conditions

;; Type checking IS sheaf gluing verification! (define (type-check expr env) (match expr [`(lambda (,params ...) ,body) ;; Check body type in extended scope (let ((body-type (type-check body (extend-env params env)))) ;; This MUST be consistent with outer env ;; That's the sheaf condition! `(-> ,(map param-type params) ,body-type))] ...)) 

Revelation:

Type soundness proofs ARE sheaf gluing proofs

"Types are preserved under evaluation" = "sections glue consistently"

3. CPS Transform IS Spec Morphism

;; CPS transform maps programs contravariantly! (define (cps-transform expr cont) (match expr [`,var (cont var)] [`(lambda (,x) ,body) (cont `(lambda (,x ,k) ,(cps-transform body k)))] [`(,f ,arg) (cps-transform f (lambda (f-val) (cps-transform arg (lambda (arg-val) `(,f-val ,arg-val ,cont)))))])) ;; This IS a scheme morphism! ;; Direct style → CPS = Spec(A) → Spec(B) 

The Unknown Unknowns

What we don't even know we're missing

1. What Other Functors Exist?

If Spec_Comp is real, what else is there?

Proj_Comp: Graded algebras → projective computational schemes?

Hom_Comp: Morphisms between computational schemes?

Tensor_Comp: Combining programs via tensor product?

2. What Are The Conservation Laws?

In physics, symmetries → conservation laws (Noether's theorem).

If computation has geometric structure, are there:

Conserved quantities (information? complexity?)

Gauge symmetries (alpha-equivalence as gauge freedom?)

Topological invariants (program complexity as winding number?)

3. What About Non-Affine Schemes?

Everything so far is affine (Spec of a single ring).

Real schemes glue affine pieces. What does this mean for programs?

;; Is a multi-module program a scheme glued from affine pieces? (define (glue-modules module1 module2 interface) ;; Each module = affine scheme ;; Interface = gluing data ;; Result = general scheme? ...) 

Concrete Implementation Roadmap

Phase 1: The Computable Core (3-6 months)

Goal: Implement what we KNOW works

;; 1. Scope Analysis Engine (define (compute-scope-topology program) (let* ((bindings (extract-all-bindings program)) (visibility-map (map compute-visibility bindings))) (make-topology visibility-map))) ;; 2. Closure Analysis (define (verify-sheaf-properties program) (let ((closures (extract-all-closures program))) (check-gluing-axiom closures) (check-uniqueness closures))) ;; 3. Visualization (define (visualize-computational-scheme program) (let ((topo (compute-scope-topology program))) (render-as-graph topo))) 

Deliverable: A tool that takes R5RS code and outputs:

Binding graph

Scope topology (as a graph)

Closure dependency diagram

Verification that basic sheaf properties hold

Phase 2: The Algebraic Mystery (6-12 months)

Goal: Discover the ring structure empirically

;; Experimental algebra finder (define (search-for-ring-structure bindings) (let ((candidates (generate-operation-candidates))) (for-each (lambda (ops) (when (satisfies-ring-axioms? ops bindings) (printf "FOUND: ~a\n" ops) (analyze-properties ops bindings))) candidates))) 

Research questions:

Generate thousands of test programs

Try different binding composition operations

Check axioms computationally

Look for patterns → conjecture ring structure

Prove it formally (separate math project)

Phase 3: The Continuation Bridge (12-18 months)

Goal: Build the k ↦ 𝔭_k map

Approach 1: Instrumenting Interpreter

;; Modified eval that tracks continuation metadata (define (tracked-eval expr env cont) (with-continuation-tracking (lambda () (log-continuation-structure cont env) (standard-eval expr env cont)))) 

Approach 2: Static Analysis

;; Compute "potential continuations" statically (define (enumerate-continuations ast) (map ast-node->continuation (ast-nodes ast))) ;; Map each to its ideal (define (continuation->ideal-static cont ast) (let ((inaccessible (compute-inaccessible-bindings cont ast))) (generate-ideal inaccessible))) 

Validation:

Run programs

Capture actual continuations at runtime

Compare with statically predicted ideals

Measure correspondence

Phase 4: Cohomology (18-24 months)

Goal: Make the higher theory computational

;; Continuation sheaf implementation (define (make-continuation-sheaf program) (lambda (open-set) (filter (lambda (k) (valid-in? k open-set)) (all-continuations program)))) ;; Cohomology computation (define (compute-cohomology sheaf topology) (let ((complex (build-cech-complex sheaf topology))) (compute-homology complex))) 

Challenge: This requires:

Enumerating continuations (possibly infinite)

Representing sheaves computationally

Efficient cohomology algorithms

The Minimum Viable Implementation

If you had to pick ONE thing to build to demonstrate this is real:

;;;; The Computational Scheme Visualizer ;;;; Shows that scope = topology, closures = sheaf sections (define (analyze-and-visualize source-file) (let* ((ast (parse-file source-file)) ;; Compute the "spectrum" (bindings (extract-bindings ast)) (points (ast-nodes ast)) ;; "continuations" ;; Compute the "topology" (open-sets (map (lambda (b) (compute-visibility b points)) bindings)) ;; Compute the "sheaf" (closures (extract-closures ast)) (sections (map (lambda (c) (cons c (closure-scope c))) closures))) ;; Render as interactive visualization (create-interactive-diagram :points points :topology open-sets :sheaf sections :verifications (list (check-sheaf-axioms sections open-sets) (check-topology-axioms open-sets) (check-correspondence bindings points))))) 

Output: An interactive web app where you:

Upload R5RS code

See the "geometric space" it defines

Click on points to see their "local ring" (environment)

See open sets corresponding to lexical scopes

Watch how closures glue together across boundaries

Value: Even without proving the full theory, this demonstrates:

The structures exist computationally

The correspondences are observable

The geometric intuition is valid

Conclusion: The Implementation Strategy

Short term (make it REAL):

Build the visualizer

Verify sheaf properties on real code

Collect empirical data about the binding algebra

Medium term (find the MATH):

Search for ring structure experimentally

Prove commutativity (or find counterexamples)

Formalize the k ↦ 𝔭_k construction

Long term (prove the THEORY):

Full formal verification in Coq/Lean

Publish mathematical proofs

Extend to non-affine schemes

The key insight: Don't wait for the full theory to be proven. Build what you CAN, learn from what it shows you, let the implementation guide the mathematics.

The geometry might already be there in working code. We just need to learn to see it.
